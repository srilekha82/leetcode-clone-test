    "description": "Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).\n\nThe algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:\nRead in and ignore any leading whitespace.\n\nCheck if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.\n\nRead in next the characters until the next non-digit charcter or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\n\nConvert these digits into an integer (i.e. `\"123\" -> 123`, `\"0032\" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\n\nIf the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.\n\nReturn the integer as the final result.\n\nNote:\nOnly the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.\n\nDo not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"42\"\nOutput: 42\nExplanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.\n\nStep 1: \"42\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"42\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n           ^\nThe parsed integer is 42.\n\nSince 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"   -42\"\nOutput: -42\nExplanation:\nStep 1: \"   -42\" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)\n            ^\nStep 2: \"   -42\" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)\n             ^\nStep 3: \"   -42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n               ^\nThe parsed integer is -42.\n\nSince -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = \"4193 with words\"\nOutput: 4193\nExplanation:\nStep 1: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"4193 with words\" (\"4193\" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)\n             ^\nThe parsed integer is 4193.\n\nSince 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: s = \"words and 987\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nStep 1: \"words and 987\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"words and 987\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"words and 987\" (reading stops immediately because there is a non-digit 'w')\n         ^\nThe parsed integer is 0 because no digits were read.\n\nSince 0 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 0.\n\n\nExample 5:\nInput: s = \"-91283472332\"\nOutput: -2147483648\nExplanation:\nStep 1: \"-91283472332\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"-91283472332\" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)\n          ^\nStep 3: \"-91283472332\" (\"91283472332\" is read in)\n                     ^\nThe parsed integer is -91283472332.\n\nSince -91283472332 is less than the lower bound of the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is clamped to -231 = -2147483648. \n\nConstraints:\n`0 <= s.length <= 200`\n`s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.",

    "description": "Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.\n\nSymbol       Value\nI             1\nV             5\nX             10\nL             50\nC             100\nD             500\nM             1000\nFor example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.\n\nRoman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:\n`I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. \n`X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. \n`C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.\n\nGiven a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"III\"\nOutput: 3\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"IV\"\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = \"IX\"\nOutput: 9\n\nExample 4:\nInput: s = \"LVIII\"\nOutput: 58\nExplanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.\n\n\nExample 5:\nInput: s = \"MCMXCIV\"\nOutput: 1994\nExplanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= s.length <= 15`\n`s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.\n\nIt is guaranteed that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.",

If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique\n\nExample 1:\nInput: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nStart at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\nTravel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8\nTravel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7\nTravel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6\nTravel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5\nTravel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.\n\nTherefore, return 3 as the starting index.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\nYou can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.\n\nLet's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\nTravel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3\nTravel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3\nYou cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.\n\nTherefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`gas.length == n`\n`cost.length == n`\n`1 <= n <= 104`\n`0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`",

    "title": "Read N Characters Given Read4",
    "description": "Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.\n\nMethod read4: \nThe API `read4` reads four consecutive characters from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.\n\nThe return value is the number of actual characters read.\n\nNote that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.\n\nDefinition of read4:\n    Parameter:  char[] buf4\n    Returns:    int\nbuf4[] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[].\n\nBelow is a high-level example of how `read4` works:\nFile file(\"abcde`\"); // File is \"`abcde`\", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'\nchar[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters\nread4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 = \"abcd\", fp points to 'e'\nread4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 = \"e\", fp points to end of file\nread4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 = \"\", fp points to end of file`\nMethod read:\nBy using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.\n\nThe return value is the number of actual characters read.\n\nDefinition of read: \n    Parameters:\tchar[] buf, int n\n    Returns:\tint\nbuf[] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf[].\n\nNote:\nConsider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.\n\nThe `read` function will only be called once for each test case.\n\nYou may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: file = \"abc\", n = 4\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain \"abc\". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.\n\nNote that \"abc\" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: file = \"abcde\", n = 5\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain \"abcde\".

    "description": "Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be called multiple times.\n\nMethod read4: \nThe API `read4` reads four consecutive characters from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.\n\nThe return value is the number of actual characters read.\n\nNote that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.\n\nDefinition of read4:\n    Parameter:  char[] buf4\n    Returns:    int\nbuf4[] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[].\n\nBelow is a high-level example of how `read4` works:\nFile file(\"abcde`\"); // File is \"`abcde`\", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'\nchar[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters\nread4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 = \"abcd\", fp points to 'e'\nread4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 = \"e\", fp points to end of file\nread4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 = \"\", fp points to end of file`\nMethod read:\nBy using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.\n\nThe return value is the number of actual characters read.\n\nDefinition of read: \n    Parameters:\tchar[] buf, int n\n    Returns:\tint\nbuf[] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf[].\n\nNote:\nConsider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.\n\nThe read function may be called multiple times.\n\nPlease remember to RESET your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for more details.\n\nYou may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: file = \"abc\", queries = [1,2,1]\nOutput: [1,2,0]\nExplanation: The test case represents the following scenario:\nFile file(\"abc\");\nSolution sol;\nsol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain \"a\". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.\n\nsol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain \"bc\". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.\n\nsol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.\n\nAssume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: file = \"abc\", queries = [4,1]\nOutput: [3,0]\nExplanation: The test case represents the following scenario:\nFile file(\"abc\");\nSolution sol;\nsol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain \"abc\". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.\n\nsol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= file.length <= 500`\n`file` consist of English letters and digits.\n\n`1 <= queries.length <= 10`\n`1 <= queries[i] <= 500`",

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.\n\nFor example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:\nIt is guaranteed that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\n\nNote that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3\nOutput: Intersected at '8'\nExplanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\n\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5].

If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as `0`.

Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends.

The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: \"Hi, A. Do you know B?\" to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).\n\nYou are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` which tells you whether A knows B.

    "description": "According to Wikipedia's article: \"The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.\"\nThe board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a `1`) or dead (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\nAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\n\nAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n\nAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n\nAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThe next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return the next state.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,1],[1,1]]\n\nConstraints:\n`m == board.length`\n`n == board[i].length`\n`1 <= m, n <= 25`\n`board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.\n\nFollow up:\nCould you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.\n\nIn this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border).

    "description": "Android devices have a special lock screen with a `3 x 3` grid of dots. Users can set an \"unlock pattern\" by connecting the dots in a specific sequence, forming a series of joined line segments where each segment's endpoints are two consecutive dots in the sequence. A sequence of `k` dots is a valid unlock pattern if both of the following are true:\nAll the dots in the sequence are distinct.\n\nIf the line segment connecting two consecutive dots in the sequence passes through any other dot, the other dot must have previously appeared in the sequence. No jumps through non-selected dots are allowed.\n\nHere are some example valid and invalid unlock patterns:\nThe 1st pattern `[4,1,3,6]` is invalid because the line connecting dots `1` and `3` pass through dot `2`, but dot `2` did not previously appear in the sequence.\n\nThe 2nd pattern `[4,1,9,2]` is invalid because the line connecting dots `1` and `9` pass through dot `5`, but dot `5` did not previously appear in the sequence.\n\nThe 3rd pattern `[2,4,1,3,6]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `3` meets the condition because dot `2` previously appeared in the sequence.\n\nThe 4th pattern `[6,5,4,1,9,2]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `9` meets the condition because dot `5` previously appeared in the sequence.\n\nGiven two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of unique and valid unlock patterns of the Android grid lock screen that consist of at least `m` keys and at most `n` keys.\n\nTwo unlock patterns are considered unique if there is a dot in one sequence that is not in the other, or the order of the dots is different.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: m = 1, n = 1\nOutput: 9\n\nExample 2:\nInput: m = 1, n = 2\nOutput: 65\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= m, n <= 9`",

    "description": "We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:\nI pick a number between `1` and `n`.\n\nYou guess a number.\n\nIf you guess the right number, you win the game.\n\nIf you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.\n\nEvery time you guess a wrong number `x`, you will pay `x` dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.\n\nGiven a particular `n`, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 10\nOutput: 16\nExplanation: The winning strategy is as follows:\n- The range is [1,10].

Otherwise, you pay $9.\n\n        - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n\n        - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n\n    - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.\n\n        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.\n\n        - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.\n\n            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.\n\n            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.\n\n            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4.

The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with two or fewer elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.\n\nFor example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.\n\nIn contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences.

    "title": "Longest Absolute File Path",
    "description": "Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:\nHere, we have `dir` as the only directory in the root. `dir` contains two subdirectories, `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and subdirectory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a subdirectory `subsubdir2`, which contains a file `file2.ext`.\n\nIn text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):\ndir\n⟶ subdir1\n⟶ ⟶ file1.ext\n⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1\n⟶ subdir2\n⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2\n⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext\nIf we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: `\"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\"`. Note that the `'\\n'` and `'\\t'` are the new-line and tab characters.\n\nEvery file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by `'/'s`. Using the above example, the absolute path to `file2.ext` is `\"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\"`. Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form `name.extension`, where `name` and `extension` consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.\n\nGiven a string `input` representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return `0`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: input = \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tfile.ext\"\nOutput: 20\nExplanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is \"dir/subdir2/file.ext\" of length 20.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: input = \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\"\nOutput: 32\nExplanation: We have two files:\n\"dir/subdir1/file1.ext\" of length 21\n\"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\" of length 32.\n\nWe return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: input = \"a\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: We do not have any files, just a single directory named \"a\".\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: input = \"file1.txt\\nfile2.txt\\nlongfile.txt\"\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: There are 3 files at the root directory.\n\nSince the absolute path for anything at the root directory is just the name itself, the answer is \"longfile.txt\" with length 12.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= input.length <= 104`\n`input` may contain lowercase or uppercase English letters, a new line character `'\\n'`, a tab character `'\\t'`, a dot `'.'`, a space `' '`, and digits.",

For example, a string such as `\"substitution\"` could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):\n`\"s10n\"` (`\"s ubstitutio n\"`)\n`\"sub4u4\"` (`\"sub stit u tion\"`)\n`\"12\"` (`\"substitution\"`)\n`\"su3i1u2on\"` (`\"su bst i t u ti on\"`)\n`\"substitution\"` (no substrings replaced)\nNote that `\"s55n\"` (`\"s ubsti tutio n\"`) is not a valid abbreviation of `\"substitution\"` because the replaced substrings are adjacent.\n\nThe length of an abbreviation is the number of letters that were not replaced plus the number of substrings that were replaced. For example, the abbreviation `\"s10n\"` has a length of `3` (`2` letters + `1` substring) and `\"su3i1u2on\"` has a length of `9` (`6` letters + `3` substrings).\n\nGiven a target string `target` and an array of strings `dictionary`, return an abbreviation of `target` with the shortest possible length such that it is not an abbreviation of any string in `dictionary`. If there are multiple shortest abbreviations, return any of them.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: target = \"apple\", dictionary = [\"blade\"]\nOutput: \"a4\"\nExplanation: The shortest abbreviation of \"apple\" is \"5\", but this is also an abbreviation of \"blade\".\n\nThe next shortest abbreviations are \"a4\" and \"4e\". \"4e\" is an abbreviation of blade while \"a4\" is not.\n\nHence, return \"a4\".\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: target = \"apple\", dictionary = [\"blade\",\"plain\",\"amber\"]\nOutput: \"1p3\"\nExplanation: \"5\" is an abbreviation of both \"apple\" but also every word in the dictionary.\n\n\"a4\" is an abbreviation of \"apple\" but also \"amber\".\n\n\"4e\" is an abbreviation of \"apple\" but also \"blade\".\n\n\"1p3\", \"2p2\", and \"3l1\" are the next shortest abbreviations of \"apple\".\n\nSince none of them are abbreviations of words in the dictionary, returning any of them is correct.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`target.length == m`\n`dictionary.length == n`\n`1 <= m <= 21`\n`0 <= n <= 1000`\n`1 <= dictionary[i] <= 100`\n`log2(n) + m <= 21` if `n > 0`",

    "description": "Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0's` and `1's` only. We want to represent the `grid` with a Quad-Tree.\n\nReturn the root of the Quad-Tree representing the `grid`.\n\nNotice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when `isLeaf` is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\n\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n`val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. \n`isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\n\nIf the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\n\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\n\nQuad-Tree format:\nThe output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\n\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.\n\nIf the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as 1 in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as 0.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:\nNotice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nExplanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.\n\nThe topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.\n\nThe topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.\n\nExplanation is shown in the photo below:\n\nExample 3:\nInput: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]\nOutput: [[1,1]]\n\nExample 4:\nInput: grid = [[0]]\nOutput: [[1,0]]\n\nExample 5:\nInput: grid = [[1,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1],[0,0,1,1]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0],[1,1]]\n\nConstraints:\n`n == grid.length == grid[i].length`\n`n == 2^x` where `0 <= x <= 6`",

Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as `[[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]]`.\n\nGiven a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.\n\nNote:\nA transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z).

If the ball can't drop in the hole, return `\"impossible\"`.\n\nIf there is a way for the ball to drop in the hole, the answer `instructions` should contain the characters `'u'` (i.e., up), `'d'` (i.e., down), `'l'` (i.e., left), and `'r'` (i.e., right).\n\nThe distance is the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included).\n\nYou may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls (see examples).\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: maze = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0,0]], ball = [4,3], hole = [0,1]\nOutput: \"lul\"\nExplanation: There are two shortest ways for the ball to drop into the hole.\n\nThe first way is left -> up -> left, represented by \"lul\".\n\nThe second way is up -> left, represented by 'ul'.\n\nBoth ways have shortest distance 6, but the first way is lexicographically smaller because 'l' < 'u'. So the output is \"lul\".\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: maze = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0,0]], ball = [4,3], hole = [3,0]\nOutput: \"impossible\"\nExplanation: The ball cannot reach the hole.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: maze = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,1]], ball = [0,4], hole = [3,5]\nOutput: \"dldr\"\n\nConstraints:\n`m == maze.length`\n`n == maze[i].length`\n`1 <= m, n <= 100`\n`maze[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.\n\n`ball.length == 2`\n`hole.length == 2`\n`0 <= ballrow, holerow <= m`\n`0 <= ballcol, holecol <= n`\nBoth the ball and the hole exist in an empty space, and they will not be in the same position initially.\n\nThe maze contains at least 2 empty spaces.",

In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects. \nYou are given several projects. For each project i, it has a pure profit Pi and a minimum capital of Ci is needed to start the corresponding project. Initially, you have W capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.\n\nTo sum up, pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and output your final maximized capital.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: k=2, W=0, Profits=[1,2,3], Capital=[0,1,1].\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.\n\n             After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.\n\n             With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.\n\n             Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.\n\n             Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNote:\nYou may assume all numbers in the input are non-negative integers.\n\nThe length of Profits array and Capital array will not exceed 50,000.\n\nThe answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.",

    "description": "In the video game Fallout 4, the quest \"Road to Freedom\" requires players to reach a metal dial called the \"Freedom Trail Ring\", and use the dial to spell a specific keyword in order to open the door.\n\nGiven a string ring, which represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key, which represents the keyword needs to be spelled. You need to find the minimum number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.\n\nInitially, the first character of the ring is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.\n\nAt the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:\nYou can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place, which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character key[i].\n\nIf the character key[i] has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.\n\n\nExample:\nInput: ring = \"godding\", key = \"gd\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\nFor the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. \nFor the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring \"godding\" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become \"ddinggo\".\n\nAlso, we need 1 more step for spelling.\n\nSo the final output is 4.\n\nNote:\nLength of both ring and key will be in range 1 to 100.\n\nThere are only lowercase letters in both strings and might be some duplcate characters in both strings.\n\nIt's guaranteed that string key could always be spelled by rotating the string ring.",

    "description": "You are given an array of positive integers `w` where `w[i]` describes the weight of `i``th` index (0-indexed).\n\nWe need to call the function `pickIndex()` which randomly returns an integer in the range `[0, w.length - 1]`. `pickIndex()` should return the integer proportional to its weight in the `w` array. For example, for `w = [1, 3]`, the probability of picking the index `0` is `1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25` (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the index `1` is `3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75` (i.e 75%).\n\nMore formally, the probability of picking index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput\n[\"Solution\",\"pickIndex\"]\n[[[1]],[]]\nOutput\n[null,0]\nExplanation\nSolution solution = new Solution([1]);\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 0. Since there is only one single element on the array the only option is to return the first element.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput\n[\"Solution\",\"pickIndex\",\"pickIndex\",\"pickIndex\",\"pickIndex\",\"pickIndex\"]\n[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]\nOutput\n[null,1,1,1,1,0]\nExplanation\nSolution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It's returning the second element (index = 1) that has probability of 3/4.\n\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 1\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 1\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 1\nsolution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It's returning the first element (index = 0) that has probability of 1/4.\n\nSince this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed so the following outputs can be considered correct :\n[null,1,1,1,1,0]\n[null,1,1,1,1,1]\n[null,1,1,1,0,0]\n[null,1,1,1,0,1]\n[null,1,0,1,0,0]\n......\n\nand so on.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= w.length <= 10000`\n`1 <= w[i] <= 10^5`\n`pickIndex` will be called at most `10000` times.",

Now, you're given n teams, you need to output their final contest matches in the form of a string.\n\nThe n teams are given in the form of positive integers from 1 to n, which represents their initial rank. (Rank 1 is the strongest team and Rank n is the weakest team.) We'll use parentheses('(', ')') and commas(',') to represent the contest team pairing - parentheses('(' , ')') for pairing and commas(',') for partition. During the pairing process in each round, you always need to follow the strategy of making the rather strong one pair with the rather weak one.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 2\nOutput: (1,2)\nExplanation: \nInitially, we have the team 1 and the team 2, placed like: 1,2.\n\nThen we pair the team (1,2) together with '(', ')' and ',', which is the final answer.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 4\nOutput: ((1,4),(2,3))\nExplanation: \nIn the first round, we pair the team 1 and 4, the team 2 and 3 together, as we need to make the strong team and weak team together.\n\nAnd we got (1,4),(2,3).\n\nIn the second round, the winners of (1,4) and (2,3) need to play again to generate the final winner, so you need to add the paratheses outside them.\n\nAnd we got the final answer ((1,4),(2,3)).\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: 8\nOutput: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))\nExplanation: \nFirst round: (1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5)\nSecond round: ((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))\nThird round: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))\nSince the third round will generate the final winner, you need to output the answer (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))).\n\nNote:\nThe n is in range [2, 212].\n\nWe ensure that the input n can be converted into the form 2k, where k is a positive integer.",

    "description": "A Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either 0 or 1.\n\nGiven `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`. `quadTree1` represents a `n * n` binary matrix and `quadTree2` represents another `n * n` binary matrix. \nReturn a Quad-Tree representing the `n * n` binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`.\n\nNotice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when `isLeaf` is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\n\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n`val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. \n`isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\n\nIf the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\n\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\n\nQuad-Tree format:\nThe input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\n\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.\n\nIf the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as 1 in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as 0.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0]]\n, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nOutput: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree.\n\nIf we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree.\n\nNotice that the binary matrices shown are only for illustration, you don't have to construct the binary matrix to get the result tree.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: quadTree1 = [[1,0]]\n, quadTree2 = [[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,0]]\nExplanation: Each tree represents a binary matrix of size 1*1. Each matrix contains only zero.\n\nThe resulting matrix is of size 1*1 with also zero.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: quadTree1 = [[0,0],[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\n, quadTree2 = [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,1]]\nOutput: [[1,1]]\n\nExample 4:\nInput: quadTree1 = [[0,0],[1,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\n, quadTree2 = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],null,null,null,null,[1,1],[1,0],[1,0],[1,1]]\nOutput: [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],null,null,null,null,[1,1],[1,0],[1,0],[1,1]]\n\nExample 5:\nInput: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\n, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nOutput: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\n\nConstraints:\n`quadTree1` and `quadTree2` are both valid Quad-Trees each representing a `n * n` grid.\n\n`n == 2^x` where `0 <= x <= 9`.",

    "description": "In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.\n\nYou're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.\n\nThe reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.\n\nIf the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \nnums = \n[[1,2],\n [3,4]]\nr = 1, c = 4\nOutput: \n[[1,2,3,4]]\nExplanation:The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4].

    "title": "Maximum Vacation Days",
    "description": "LeetCode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among N cities to collect algorithm problems. But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.\n\nRules and restrictions:\nYou can only travel among N cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.\n\nThe cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a N*N matrix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i.\n\nYou totally have K weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time.\n\nFor each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an N*K matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j.\n\nYou're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the maximum vacation days you could take during K weeks.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: Ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. \nOne of the best strategies is:\n1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day. (Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is Monday.) \n2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days.\n\n3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput:flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Ans = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. \nSince there is no flights enable you to move to another city, you have to stay at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks. For each week, you only have one day to play and six days to work. So the maximum number of vacation days is 3.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]]\nOutput: 21\nExplanation:Ans = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21\nOne of the best strategies is:\n1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days. \n2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 7 days.\n\n3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 7 days.\n\nNote:\nN and K are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100].\n\nIn the matrix flights, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1].\n\nIn the matrix days, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7].\n\nYou could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days.\n\nIf you fly from the city A to the city B and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city B in that week.\n\nWe don't consider the impact of flight hours towards the calculation of vacation days.",

    "title": "Tag Validator",
    "description": "Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:\nThe code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.\n\nA closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`. Among them, `<TAG_NAME>` is the start tag, and `</TAG_NAME>` is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\n\nA valid `TAG_NAME` only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the `TAG_NAME` is invalid.\n\nA valid `TAG_CONTENT` may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the `TAG_CONTENT` is invalid.\n\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\n\nA `<` is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent `>`. And when you find a `<` or `</`, all the subsequent characters until the next `>` should be parsed as TAG_NAME  (not necessarily valid).\n\nThe cdata has the following format : `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`. The range of `CDATA_CONTENT` is defined as the characters between `<![CDATA[` and the first subsequent `]]>`. \n`CDATA_CONTENT` may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse `CDATA_CONTENT`, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. \n\nValid Code Examples:\nInput: \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.\n\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n\nInput: \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\n\nstart_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\nend_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\n\ntext1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\ncdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\ntext2 -> \"]]>>]\"\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\n\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\n\n\nInvalid Code Examples:\nInput: \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\nOutput: False\nExplanation: Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa.\n\nInput: \"<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nNote:\nFor simplicity, you could assume the input code (including the any characters mentioned above) only contain `letters`, `digits`, `'<'`,`'>'`,`'/'`,`'!'`,`'['`,`']'` and `' '`.",

The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called \"Ring Buffer\".\n\nOne of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.\n\nImplementation the `MyCircularQueue` class:\n`MyCircularQueue(k)` Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be `k`.\n\n`int Front()` Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.\n\n`int Rear()` Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.\n\n`boolean enQueue(int value)` Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return `true` if the operation is successful.\n\n`boolean deQueue()` Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return `true` if the operation is successful.\n\n`boolean isEmpty()` Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.\n\n`boolean isFull()` Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput\n[\"MyCircularQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"Rear\", \"isFull\", \"deQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"Rear\"]\n[[3], [1], [2], [3], [4], [], [], [], [4], []]\nOutput\n[null, true, true, true, false, 3, true, true, true, 4]\nExplanation\nMyCircularQueue myCircularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3);\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(1); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(2); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(3); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return False\nmyCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 3\nmyCircularQueue.isFull();   // return True\nmyCircularQueue.deQueue();  // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 4\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= k <= 1000`\n`0 <= value <= 1000`\nAt most `3000` calls will be made to `enQueue`, `deQueue`, `Front`, `Rear`, `isEmpty`, and `isFull`.\n\nFollow up: Could you solve the problem without using the built-in queue?",

The Excel form content is represented by a height * width 2D integer array `C`, it should be initialized to zero. You should assume that the first row of `C` starts from 1, and the first column of `C` starts from 'A'.\n\n`void Set(int row, char column, int val):` Change the value at `C(row, column)` to be val.\n\n`int Get(int row, char column):` Return the value at `C(row, column)`.\n\n`int Sum(int row, char column, List of Strings : numbers):` This function calculate and set the value at `C(row, column)`, where the value should be the sum of cells represented by `numbers`. This function return the sum result at `C(row, column)`. This sum formula should exist until this cell is overlapped by another value or another sum formula.\n\n`numbers` is a list of strings that each string represent a cell or a range of cells. If the string represent a single cell, then it has the following format : `ColRow`. For example, \"F7\" represents the cell at (7, F). \nIf the string represent a range of cells, then it has the following format : `ColRow1:ColRow2`. The range will always be a rectangle, and ColRow1 represent the position of the top-left cell, and ColRow2 represents the position of the bottom-right cell. \n\nExample 1:\nExcel(3,\"C\"); \n// construct a 3*3 2D array with all zero.\n\n//   A B C\n// 1 0 0 0\n// 2 0 0 0\n// 3 0 0 0\nSet(1, \"A\", 2);\n// set C(1,\"A\") to be 2.\n\n//   A B C\n// 1 2 0 0\n// 2 0 0 0\n// 3 0 0 0\nSum(3, \"C\", [\"A1\", \"A1:B2\"]);\n// set C(3,\"C\") to be the sum of value at C(1,\"A\") and the values sum of the rectangle range whose top-left cell is C(1,\"A\") and bottom-right cell is C(2,\"B\"). Return 4. \n//   A B C\n// 1 2 0 0\n// 2 0 0 0\n// 3 0 0 4\nSet(2, \"B\", 2);\n// set C(2,\"B\") to be 2. Note C(3, \"C\") should also be changed.\n\n//   A B C\n// 1 2 0 0\n// 2 0 2 0\n// 3 0 0 6\nNote:\nYou could assume that there won't be any circular sum reference. For example, A1 = sum(B1) and B1 = sum(A1).\n\n The test cases are using double-quotes to represent a character.\n\nPlease remember to RESET your class variables declared in class Excel, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases.

    "title": "Exclusive Time of Functions",
    "description": "On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing `n` functions. Each function has a unique ID between `0` and `n-1`.\n\nFunction calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n\nYou are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `ith` log message formatted as a string `\"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\"`. For example, `\"0:start:3\"` means a function call with function ID `0` started at the beginning of timestamp `3`, and `\"1:end:2\"` means a function call with function ID `1` ended at the end of timestamp `2`. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\n\nA function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for `2` time units and another call executing for `1` time unit, the exclusive time is `2 + 1 = 3`.\n\nReturn the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the `ith` index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID `i`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"1:start:2\",\"1:end:5\",\"0:end:6\"]\nOutput: [3,4]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\n\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\n\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"0:start:6\",\"0:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [8]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\n\nFunction 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\n\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:6\",\"1:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [7,1]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\n\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\n\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\n\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 units of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\n\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\n\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:7\",\"1:end:7\",\"0:end:8\"]\nOutput: [8,1]\n\nExample 5:\nInput: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:end:0\"]\nOutput: [1]\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= n <= 100`\n`1 <= logs.length <= 500`\n`0 <= function_id < n`\n`0 <= timestamp <= 109`\nNo two start events will happen at the same timestamp.\n\nNo two end events will happen at the same timestamp.\n\nEach function has an `\"end\"` log for each `\"start\"` log.",

For example, `\"11106\"` can be mapped into:\n`\"AAJF\"` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`\n`\"KJF\"` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`\nNote that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `\"06\"` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `\"6\"` is different from `\"06\"`.\n\nIn addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the `'*'` character, which can represent any digit from `'1'` to `'9'` (`'0'` is excluded). For example, the encoded message `\"1*\"` may represent any of the encoded messages `\"11\"`, `\"12\"`, `\"13\"`, `\"14\"`, `\"15\"`, `\"16\"`, `\"17\"`, `\"18\"`, or `\"19\"`. Decoding `\"1*\"` is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.\n\nGiven a string `s` containing digits and the `'*'` character, return the number of ways to decode it.\n\nSince the answer may be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"*\"\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", or \"9\".\n\nEach of these can be decoded to the strings \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", and \"I\" respectively.\n\nHence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode \"*\".\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"1*\"\nOutput: 18\nExplanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \"16\", \"17\", \"18\", or \"19\".\n\nEach of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. \"11\" can be decoded to \"AA\" or \"K\").\n\nHence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode \"1*\".\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = \"2*\"\nOutput: 15\nExplanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"21\", \"22\", \"23\", \"24\", \"25\", \"26\", \"27\", \"28\", or \"29\".\n\n\"21\", \"22\", \"23\", \"24\", \"25\", and \"26\" have 2 ways of being decoded, but \"27\", \"28\", and \"29\" only have 1 way.\n\nHence, there are a total of (6 * 2) + (3 * 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 ways to decode \"2*\".\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= s.length <= 105`\n`s[i]` is a digit or `'*'`.",

    "title": "Design Search Autocomplete System",
    "description": "Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character `'#'`). For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:\nThe hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.\n\nThe returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).\n\nIf less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.\n\nWhen the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.\n\nYour job is to implement the following functions:\nThe constructor function:\n`AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times):` This is the constructor. The input is historical data. `Sentences` is a string array consists of previously typed sentences. `Times` is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.\n\nNow, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next character the user types:\n`List<String> input(char c):` The input `c` is the next character typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters (`'a'` to `'z'`), blank space (`' '`) or a special character (`'#'`). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output will be the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.\n\n\nExample:\nOperation: AutocompleteSystem([\"i love you\", \"island\",\"ironman\", \"i love leetcode\"], [5,3,2,2])\nThe system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding times:\n`\"i love you\"` : `5` times\n`\"island\"` : `3` times\n`\"ironman\"` : `2` times\n`\"i love leetcode\"` : `2` times\nNow, the user begins another search:\nOperation: input('i')\nOutput: [\"i love you\", \"island\",\"i love leetcode\"]\nExplanation:\nThere are four sentences that have prefix `\"i\"`. Among them, \"ironman\" and \"i love leetcode\" have same hot degree. Since `' '` has ASCII code 32 and `'r'` has ASCII code 114, \"i love leetcode\" should be in front of \"ironman\". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so \"ironman\" will be ignored.\n\nOperation: input(' ')\nOutput: [\"i love you\",\"i love leetcode\"]\nExplanation:\nThere are only two sentences that have prefix `\"i \"`.\n\nOperation: input('a')\nOutput: []\nExplanation:\nThere are no sentences that have prefix `\"i a\"`.\n\nOperation: input('#')\nOutput: []\nExplanation:\nThe user finished the input, the sentence `\"i a\"` should be saved as a historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search.\n\nNote:\nThe input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and only one blank space will exist between two words.\n\nThe number of complete sentences that to be searched won't exceed 100. The length of each sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed 100.\n\nPlease use double-quote instead of single-quote when you write test cases even for a character input.\n\nPlease remember to RESET your class variables declared in class AutocompleteSystem, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases.

    "description": "Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program `source` is an array where `source[i]` is the `i`-th line of the source code.  This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character `\\n`.\n\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n\nThe string `//` denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\n\nThe string `/*` denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of `*/` should be ignored.  (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.)  To be clear, the string `/*/` does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string `//` occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string `/*` occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.  For example, `source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\"` will not be a test case.  (Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.)\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so `/*` outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.  Please see the examples below for details.\n\nAfter removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \nsource = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \"  // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \"   multiline  \", \"   comment for \", \"   testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"]\nThe line by line code is visualized as below:\n/*Test program */\nint main()\n{ \n  // variable declaration \nint a, b, c;\n/* This is a test\n   multiline  \n   comment for \n   testing */\na = b + c;\n}\nOutput: [\"int main()\",\"{ \",\"  \",\"int a, b, c;\",\"a = b + c;\",\"}\"]\nThe line by line code is visualized as below:\nint main()\n{ \n  \nint a, b, c;\na = b + c;\n}\nExplanation: \nThe string `/*` denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string `//` denotes line 4 as comments.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \nsource = [\"a/*comment\", \"line\", \"more_comment*/b\"]\nOutput: [\"ab\"]\nExplanation: The original source string is \"a/*comment\\nline\\nmore_comment*/b\", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"].\n\nNote:\nThe length of `source` is in the range `[1, 100]`.\n\nThe length of `source[i]` is in the range `[0, 80]`.\n\nEvery open block comment is eventually closed.\n\nThere are no single-quote, double-quote, or control characters in the source code.",

A value of `board[i][j] = 0` represents that the cell at position `(i, j)` is empty. The given board represents the state of the game following the player's move. Now, you need to restore the board to a stable state by crushing candies according to the following rules:\nIf three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or horizontally, \"crush\" them all at the same time - these positions become empty.\n\nAfter crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the board has candies on top of itself, then these candies will drop until they hit a candy or bottom at the same time. (No new candies will drop outside the top boundary.)\nAfter the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed. If so, you need to repeat the above steps.\n\nIf there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (ie. the board is stable), then return the current board.\n\nYou need to perform the above rules until the board becomes stable, then return the current board.\n\n\nExample:\nInput:\nboard = \n[[110,5,112,113,114],[210,211,5,213,214],[310,311,3,313,314],[410,411,412,5,414],[5,1,512,3,3],[610,4,1,613,614],[710,1,2,713,714],[810,1,2,1,1],[1,1,2,2,2],[4,1,4,4,1014]]\nOutput:\n[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[110,0,0,0,114],[210,0,0,0,214],[310,0,0,113,314],[410,0,0,213,414],[610,211,112,313,614],[710,311,412,613,714],[810,411,512,713,1014]]\nExplanation: \nNote:\nThe length of `board` will be in the range [3, 50].\n\nThe length of `board[i]` will be in the range [3, 50].\n\nEach `board[i][j]` will initially start as an integer in the range [1, 2000].",

    "title": "Parse Lisp Expression",
    "description": "You are given a string `expression` representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.\n\nThe syntax for these expressions is given as follows.\n\nAn expression is either an integer, a let-expression, an add-expression, a mult-expression, or an assigned variable.  Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n\n(An integer could be positive or negative.)\nA let-expression takes the form `(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)`, where `let` is always the string `\"let\"`, then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable `v1` is assigned the value of the expression `e1`, the second variable `v2` is assigned the value of the expression `e2`, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression `expr`.\n\nAn add-expression takes the form `(add e1 e2)` where `add` is always the string `\"add\"`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.\n\nA mult-expression takes the form `(mult e1 e2)` where `mult` is always the string `\"mult\"`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names.  A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits.  Additionally for your convenience, the names \"add\", \"let\", or \"mult\" are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n\nFinally, there is the concept of scope.  When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.  It is guaranteed that every expression is legal.  Please see the examples for more details on scope.\n\n\nEvaluation Examples:\nInput: (add 1 2)\nOutput: 3\nInput: (mult 3 (add 2 3))\nOutput: 15\nInput: (let x 2 (mult x 5))\nOutput: 10\nInput: (let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\n\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n\nInput: (let x 3 x 2 x)\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n\nInput: (let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\n\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n\nInput: (let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x))\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context\nof the final x in the add-expression.  That final x will equal 2.\n\nInput: (let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2) \nOutput 4\nExplanation: Variable names can contain digits after the first character.\n\nNote:\nThe given string `expression` is well formatted: There are no leading or trailing spaces, there is only a single space separating different components of the string, and no space between adjacent parentheses.  The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.\n\nThe length of `expression` is at most 2000.  (It is also non-empty, as that would not be a legal expression.)\nThe answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.",

For example, if \"great\" and \"good\" are similar, and \"fine\" and \"good\" are similar, then \"great\" and \"fine\" are similar.\n\nSimilarity is also symmetric. For example, \"great\" and \"fine\" being similar is the same as \"fine\" and \"great\" being similar.\n\nAlso, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences `words1 = [\"great\"], words2 = [\"great\"], pairs = []` are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.\n\nFinally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words.

    "title": "Shortest Completing Word",
    "description": "Given a string `licensePlate` and an array of strings `words`, find the shortest completing word in `words`.\n\nA completing word is a word that contains all the letters in `licensePlate`. Ignore numbers and spaces in `licensePlate`, and treat letters as case insensitive. If a letter appears more than once in `licensePlate`, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.\n\nFor example, if `licensePlate`` = \"aBc 12c\"`, then it contains letters `'a'`, `'b'` (ignoring case), and `'c'` twice. Possible completing words are `\"abccdef\"`, `\"caaacab\"`, and `\"cbca\"`.\n\nReturn the shortest completing word in `words`. It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that occurs in `words`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: licensePlate = \"1s3 PSt\", words = [\"step\",\"steps\",\"stripe\",\"stepple\"]\nOutput: \"steps\"\nExplanation: licensePlate contains letters 's', 'p', 's' (ignoring case), and 't'.\n\n\"step\" contains 't' and 'p', but only contains 1 's'.\n\n\"steps\" contains 't', 'p', and both 's' characters.\n\n\"stripe\" is missing an 's'.\n\n\"stepple\" is missing an 's'.\n\nSince \"steps\" is the only word containing all the letters, that is the answer.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: licensePlate = \"1s3 456\", words = [\"looks\",\"pest\",\"stew\",\"show\"]\nOutput: \"pest\"\nExplanation: licensePlate only contains the letter 's'. All the words contain 's', but among these \"pest\", \"stew\", and \"show\" are shortest. The answer is \"pest\" because it is the word that appears earliest of the 3.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: licensePlate = \"Ah71752\", words = [\"suggest\",\"letter\",\"of\",\"husband\",\"easy\",\"education\",\"drug\",\"prevent\",\"writer\",\"old\"]\nOutput: \"husband\"\n\nExample 4:\nInput: licensePlate = \"OgEu755\", words = [\"enough\",\"these\",\"play\",\"wide\",\"wonder\",\"box\",\"arrive\",\"money\",\"tax\",\"thus\"]\nOutput: \"enough\"\n\nExample 5:\nInput: licensePlate = \"iMSlpe4\", words = [\"claim\",\"consumer\",\"student\",\"camera\",\"public\",\"never\",\"wonder\",\"simple\",\"thought\",\"use\"]\nOutput: \"simple\"\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= licensePlate.length <= 7`\n`licensePlate` contains digits, letters (uppercase or lowercase), or space `' '`.\n\n`1 <= words.length <= 1000`\n`1 <= words[i].length <= 15`\n`words[i]` consists of lower case English letters.",

    "description": "A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.\n\nThe world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where `0` represents uninfected cells, and `1` represents cells contaminated with the virus.  A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.\n\nEvery night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall.\n\nResources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region -- the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night. There will never be a tie.\n\nCan you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not, and the world becomes fully infected, return the number of walls used.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: grid = \n[[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: 10\nExplanation:\nThere are 2 contaminated regions.\n\nOn the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left.

    "description": "Given an `expression` such as `expression = \"e + 8 - a + 5\"` and an evaluation map such as `{\"e\": 1}` (given in terms of `evalvars = [\"e\"]` and `evalints = [1]`), return a list of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as `[\"-1*a\",\"14\"]`\nAn expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.\n\nA chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.\n\nA variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like `\"2x\"` or `\"-x\"`.\n\nExpressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction. For example, `expression = \"1 + 2 * 3\"` has an answer of `[\"7\"]`.\n\nThe format of the output is as follows:\nFor each term of free variables with non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a term like `\"b*a*c\"`, only `\"a*b*c\"`.\n\nTerms have degree equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. (For example, `\"a*a*b*c\"` has degree 4.) We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.\n\nThe leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.)  A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.\n\nAn example of a well formatted answer is `[\"-2*a*a*a\", \"3*a*a*b\", \"3*b*b\", \"4*a\", \"5*c\", \"-6\"]` \nTerms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.  For example, an expression of \"0\" has an output of [].\n\n\nExamples:\nInput: expression = \"e + 8 - a + 5\", evalvars = [\"e\"], evalints = [1]\nOutput: [\"-1*a\",\"14\"]\nInput: expression = \"e - 8 + temperature - pressure\",\nevalvars = [\"e\", \"temperature\"], evalints = [1, 12]\nOutput: [\"-1*pressure\",\"5\"]\nInput: expression = \"(e + 8) * (e - 8)\", evalvars = [], evalints = []\nOutput: [\"1*e*e\",\"-64\"]\nInput: expression = \"7 - 7\", evalvars = [], evalints = []\nOutput: []\nInput: expression = \"a * b * c + b * a * c * 4\", evalvars = [], evalints = []\nOutput: [\"5*a*b*c\"]\nInput: expression = \"((a - b) * (b - c) + (c - a)) * ((a - b) + (b - c) * (c - a))\",\nevalvars = [], evalints = []\nOutput: [\"-1*a*a*b*b\",\"2*a*a*b*c\",\"-1*a*a*c*c\",\"1*a*b*b*b\",\"-1*a*b*b*c\",\"-1*a*b*c*c\",\"1*a*c*c*c\",\"-1*b*b*b*c\",\"2*b*b*c*c\",\"-1*b*c*c*c\",\"2*a*a*b\",\"-2*a*a*c\",\"-2*a*b*b\",\"2*a*c*c\",\"1*b*b*b\",\"-1*b*b*c\",\"1*b*c*c\",\"-1*c*c*c\",\"-1*a*a\",\"1*a*b\",\"1*a*c\",\"-1*b*c\"]\nNote:\n`expression` will have length in range `[1, 250]`.\n\n`evalvars, evalints` will have equal lengths in range `[0, 100]`.",

Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth 1 point. \nFor example, if we have `[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]`, and we rotate by `K = 2`, it becomes `[1, 3, 0, 2, 4]`.

We'll call such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.\n\nReturn the number of different transformations among all words we have.\n\n\nExample:\nInput: words = [\"gin\", \"zen\", \"gig\", \"msg\"]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nThe transformation of each word is:\n\"gin\" -> \"--...-.\"\n\"zen\" -> \"--...-.\"\n\"gig\" -> \"--...--.\"\n\"msg\" -> \"--...--.\"\nThere are 2 different transformations, \"--...-.\" and \"--...--.\".\n\nNote:\nThe length of `words` will be at most `100`.\n\nEach `words[i]` will have length in range `[1, 12]`.\n\n`words[i]` will only consist of lowercase letters.",

Return a list of strings representing all possibilities for what our original coordinates could have been.\n\nOur original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started with numbers like \"00\", \"0.0\", \"0.00\", \"1.0\", \"001\", \"00.01\", or any other number that can be represented with less digits.  Also, a decimal point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occuring before it, so we never started with numbers like \".1\".\n\nThe final answer list can be returned in any order.

    "description": "We are given a personal information string `S`, which may represent either an email address or a phone number.\n\nWe would like to mask this personal information according to the following rules:\n1. Email address:\nWe define a name to be a string of `length ≥ 2` consisting of only lowercase letters `a-z` or uppercase letters `A-Z`.\n\nAn email address starts with a name, followed by the symbol `'@'`, followed by a name, followed by the dot `'.'` and followed by a name. \nAll email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in the format of `\"name1@name2.name3\".`\nTo mask an email, all names must be converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of the first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks `'*'`.\n\n2. Phone number:\nA phone number is a string consisting of only the digits `0-9` or the characters from the set `{'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}.` You may assume a phone number contains 10 to 13 digits.\n\nThe last 10 digits make up the local number, while the digits before those make up the country code. Note that the country code is optional. We want to expose only the last 4 digits and mask all other digits.\n\nThe local number should be formatted and masked as `\"***-***-1111\", `where `1` represents the exposed digits.\n\nTo mask a phone number with country code like `\"+111 111 111 1111\"`, we write it in the form `\"+***-***-***-1111\".`  The `'+'` sign and the first `'-'` sign before the local number should only exist if there is a country code.  For example, a 12 digit phone number mask should start with `\"+**-\"`.\n\nNote that extraneous characters like `\"(\", \")\", \" \"`, as well as extra dashes or plus signs not part of the above formatting scheme should be removed.\n\nReturn the correct \"mask\" of the information provided.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \"LeetCode@LeetCode.com\"\nOutput: \"l*****e@leetcode.com\"\nExplanation: All names are converted to lowercase, and the letters between the\n             first and last letter of the first name is replaced by 5 asterisks.\n\n             Therefore, \"leetcode\" -> \"l*****e\".\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \"AB@qq.com\"\nOutput: \"a*****b@qq.com\"\nExplanation: There must be 5 asterisks between the first and last letter \n             of the first name \"ab\". Therefore, \"ab\" -> \"a*****b\".\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: \"1(234)567-890\"\nOutput: \"***-***-7890\"\nExplanation: 10 digits in the phone number, which means all digits make up the local number.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: \"86-(10)12345678\"\nOutput: \"+**-***-***-5678\"\nExplanation: 12 digits, 2 digits for country code and 10 digits for local number. \nNotes:\n`S.length <= 40`.\n\nEmails have length at least 8.\n\nPhone numbers have length at least 10.",

The rule is that if `x` starts at position `i` in the original string `S`, then we will replace that occurrence of `x` with `y`.  If not, we do nothing.\n\nFor example, if we have `S = \"abcd\"` and we have some replacement operation `i = 2, x = \"cd\", y = \"ffff\"`, then because `\"cd\"` starts at position `2` in the original string `S`, we will replace it with `\"ffff\"`.\n\nUsing another example on `S = \"abcd\"`, if we have both the replacement operation `i = 0, x = \"ab\", y = \"eee\"`, as well as another replacement operation `i = 2, x = \"ec\", y = \"ffff\"`, this second operation does nothing because in the original string `S[2] = 'c'`, which doesn't match `x[0] = 'e'`.\n\nAll these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, `S = \"abc\", indexes = [0, 1], sources = [\"ab\",\"bc\"]` is not a valid test case.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: S = \"abcd\", indexes = [0, 2], sources = [\"a\", \"cd\"], targets = [\"eee\", \"ffff\"]\nOutput: \"eeebffff\"\nExplanation:\n\"a\" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by \"eee\".\n\n\"cd\" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by \"ffff\".\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: S = \"abcd\", indexes = [0, 2], sources = [\"ab\",\"ec\"], targets = [\"eee\",\"ffff\"]\nOutput: \"eeecd\"\nExplanation:\n\"ab\" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by \"eee\".\n\n\"ec\" doesn't starts at index 2 in the original S, so we do nothing.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`0 <= S.length <= 1000`\n`S` consists of only lowercase English letters.\n\n`0 <= indexes.length <= 100`\n`0 <= indexes[i] < S.length`\n`sources.length == indexes.length`\n`targets.length == indexes.length`\n`1 <= sources[i].length, targets[i].length <= 50`\n`sources[i]` and `targets[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.",

    "description": "On an N x N `board`, the numbers from `1` to `N*N` are written boustrophedonically starting from the bottom left of the board, and alternating direction each row.  For example, for a 6 x 6 board, the numbers are written as follows:\nYou start on square `1` of the board (which is always in the last row and first column).  Each move, starting from square `x`, consists of the following:\nYou choose a destination square `S` with number `x+1`, `x+2`, `x+3`, `x+4`, `x+5`, or `x+6`, provided this number is `<= N*N`.\n\n\t\n(This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.)\nIf `S` has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to `S`.\n\nA board square on row `r` and column `c` has a \"snake or ladder\" if `board[r][c] != -1`.  The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`.\n\nNote that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not continue moving.  (For example, if the board is `[[4,-1],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move your destination square is `2`, then you finish your first move at `3`, because you do not continue moving to `4`.)\nReturn the least number of moves required to reach square N*N.  If it is not possible, return `-1`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [\n[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],\n[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],\n[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],\n[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],\n[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],\n[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: \nAt the beginning, you start at square 1 [at row 5, column 0].\n\nYou decide to move to square 2, and must take the ladder to square 15.\n\nYou then decide to move to square 17 (row 3, column 5), and must take the snake to square 13.\n\nYou then decide to move to square 14, and must take the ladder to square 35.\n\nYou then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.\n\nIt can be shown that you need at least 4 moves to reach the N*N-th square, so the answer is 4.\n\nNote:\n`2 <= board.length = board[0].length <= 20`\n`board[i][j]` is between `1` and `N*N` or is equal to `-1`.\n\nThe board square with number `1` has no snake or ladder.\n\nThe board square with number `N*N` has no snake or ladder.",

Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.\n\nYou may jump forward from index `i` to index `j` (with `i < j`) in the following way:\nDuring odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] <= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.\n\nDuring even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] >= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.\n\nIt may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps.\n\nA starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index `arr.length - 1`) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).\n\nReturn the number of good starting indices.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.\n\nFrom starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.\n\nFrom starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.\n\nFrom starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.\n\nIn total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of\njumps.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:\nDuring our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].\n\nDuring our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3\nDuring our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].\n\nWe can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.\n\nIn a similar manner, we can deduce that:\nFrom starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\n\nFrom starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.\n\nFrom starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\n\nFrom starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.\n\nIn total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some\nnumber of jumps.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 104`\n`0 <= arr[i] < 105`",

The root of the tree is at `(0, 0)`.\n\nThe vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.\n\nReturn the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\nOutput: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]\nExplanation:\nColumn -1: Only node 9 is in this column.\n\nColumn 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.\n\nColumn 1: Only node 20 is in this column.\n\nColumn 2: Only node 7 is in this column.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\nOutput: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]\nExplanation:\nColumn -2: Only node 4 is in this column.\n\nColumn -1: Only node 2 is in this column.\n\nColumn 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.\n\n          1 is at the top, so it comes first.\n\n          5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.\n\nColumn 1: Only node 3 is in this column.\n\nColumn 2: Only node 7 is in this column.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,6,5,7]\nOutput: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]\nExplanation:\nThis case is the exact same as example 2, but with nodes 5 and 6 swapped.\n\nNote that the solution remains the same since 5 and 6 are in the same location and should be ordered by their values.\n\n\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.\n\n`0 <= Node.val <= 1000`",

Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.\n\nOur goal is to assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the (worker, bike) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other, and assign the bike to that worker. (If there are multiple (worker, bike) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker index; if there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest bike index). We repeat this process until there are no available workers.\n\nThe Manhattan distance between two points `p1` and `p2` is `Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|`.\n\nReturn a vector `ans` of length `N`, where `ans[i]` is the index (0-indexed) of the bike that the `i`-th worker is assigned to.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]\nOutput: [1,0]\nExplanation: \nWorker 1 grabs Bike 0 as they are closest (without ties), and Worker 0 is assigned Bike 1.

    "description": "Given strings `A` and `B` of the same length, we say A[i] and B[i] are equivalent characters. For example, if `A = \"abc\"` and `B = \"cde\"`, then we have `'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', 'c' == 'e'`.\n\nEquivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:\nReflexivity: 'a' == 'a'\nSymmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'\nTransitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'\nFor example, given the equivalency information from `A` and `B` above, `S = \"eed\"`, `\"acd\"`, and `\"aab\"` are equivalent strings, and `\"aab\"` is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `S`.\n\nReturn the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `S` by using the equivalency information from `A` and `B`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: A = \"parker\", B = \"morris\", S = \"parser\"\nOutput: \"makkek\"\nExplanation: Based on the equivalency information in `A` and `B`, we can group their characters as `[m,p]`, `[a,o]`, `[k,r,s]`, `[e,i]`. The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order. So the answer is `\"makkek\"`.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: A = \"hello\", B = \"world\", S = \"hold\"\nOutput: \"hdld\"\nExplanation:  Based on the equivalency information in `A` and `B`, we can group their characters as `[h,w]`, `[d,e,o]`, `[l,r]`. So only the second letter `'o'` in `S` is changed to `'d'`, the answer is `\"hdld\"`.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: A = \"leetcode\", B = \"programs\", S = \"sourcecode\"\nOutput: \"aauaaaaada\"\nExplanation:  We group the equivalent characters in `A` and `B` as `[a,o,e,r,s,c]`, `[l,p]`, `[g,t]` and `[d,m]`, thus all letters in `S` except `'u'` and `'d'` are transformed to `'a'`, the answer is `\"aauaaaaada\"`.\n\nNote:\nString `A`, `B` and `S` consist of only lowercase English letters from `'a'` - `'z'`.\n\nThe lengths of string `A`, `B` and `S` are between `1` and `1000`.\n\nString `A` and `B` are of the same length.",

These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must be able to immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.\n\nIn other words:\nIf an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it has to wait for two hydrogen threads.\n\nIf a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it has to wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.\n\nWe don’t have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; that is, the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is just that threads pass the barrier in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bond and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.\n\nWrite synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \"HOH\"\nOutput: \"HHO\"\nExplanation: \"HOH\" and \"OHH\" are also valid answers.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \"OOHHHH\"\nOutput: \"HHOHHO\"\nExplanation: \"HOHHHO\", \"OHHHHO\", \"HHOHOH\", \"HOHHOH\", \"OHHHOH\", \"HHOOHH\", \"HOHOHH\" and \"OHHOHH\" are also valid answers.\n\n\nConstraints:\nTotal length of input string will be 3n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.\n\nTotal number of `H` will be 2n in the input string.\n\nTotal number of `O` will be n in the input string.",

The `size` method will be called after every test case.\n\nPlease do not use built-in implementations of bounded blocking queue as this will not be accepted in an interview.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n1\n1\n[\"BoundedBlockingQueue\",\"enqueue\",\"dequeue\",\"dequeue\",\"enqueue\",\"enqueue\",\"enqueue\",\"enqueue\",\"dequeue\"]\n[[2],[1],[],[],[0],[2],[3],[4],[]]\nOutput:\n[1,0,2,2]\nExplanation:\nNumber of producer threads = 1\nNumber of consumer threads = 1\nBoundedBlockingQueue queue = new BoundedBlockingQueue(2);   // initialize the queue with capacity = 2.\n\nqueue.enqueue(1);   // The producer thread enqueues 1 to the queue.\n\nqueue.dequeue();    // The consumer thread calls dequeue and returns 1 from the queue.\n\nqueue.dequeue();    // Since the queue is empty, the consumer thread is blocked.\n\nqueue.enqueue(0);   // The producer thread enqueues 0 to the queue. The consumer thread is unblocked and returns 0 from the queue.\n\nqueue.enqueue(2);   // The producer thread enqueues 2 to the queue.\n\nqueue.enqueue(3);   // The producer thread enqueues 3 to the queue.\n\nqueue.enqueue(4);   // The producer thread is blocked because the queue's capacity (2) is reached.\n\nqueue.dequeue();    // The consumer thread returns 2 from the queue. The producer thread is unblocked and enqueues 4 to the queue.\n\nqueue.size();       // 2 elements remaining in the queue. size() is always called at the end of each test case.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n3\n4\n[\"BoundedBlockingQueue\",\"enqueue\",\"enqueue\",\"enqueue\",\"dequeue\",\"dequeue\",\"dequeue\",\"enqueue\"]\n[[3],[1],[0],[2],[],[],[],[3]]\nOutput:\n[1,0,2,1]\nExplanation:\nNumber of producer threads = 3\nNumber of consumer threads = 4\nBoundedBlockingQueue queue = new BoundedBlockingQueue(3);   // initialize the queue with capacity = 3.\n\nqueue.enqueue(1);   // Producer thread P1 enqueues 1 to the queue.\n\nqueue.enqueue(0);   // Producer thread P2 enqueues 0 to the queue.\n\nqueue.enqueue(2);   // Producer thread P3 enqueues 2 to the queue.\n\nqueue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C1 calls dequeue.\n\nqueue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C2 calls dequeue.\n\nqueue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C3 calls dequeue.\n\nqueue.enqueue(3);   // One of the producer threads enqueues 3 to the queue.\n\nqueue.size();       // 1 element remaining in the queue.\n\nSince the number of threads for producer/consumer is greater than 1, we do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, even though the input seems to imply the ordering. Therefore, any of the output [1,0,2] or [1,2,0] or [0,1,2] or [0,2,1] or [2,0,1] or [2,1,0] will be accepted.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= Number of Prdoucers <= 8`\n`1 <= Number of Consumers <= 8`\n`1 <= size <= 30`\n`0 <= element <= 20`\nThe number of calls to `enqueue` is greater than or equal to the number of calls to `dequeue`.\n\nAt most `40` calls will be made to `enque`, `deque`, and `size`.",

    "description": "Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.\n\nA Skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to `add`, `erase` and `search`. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.\n\nFor example: we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add `80` and `45` into it. The Skiplist works this way:\nArtyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, `add` , `erase` and `search `can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).\n\nTo be specific, your design should include these functions:\n`bool search(int target)` : Return whether the `target` exists in the Skiplist or not.\n\n`void add(int num)`: Insert a value into the SkipList. \n`bool erase(int num)`: Remove a value in the Skiplist. If `num` does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple `num` values, removing any one of them is fine.\n\nSee more about Skiplist : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.\n\n\nExample:\nSkiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();\nskiplist.add(1);\nskiplist.add(2);\nskiplist.add(3);\nskiplist.search(0);   // return false.\n\nskiplist.add(4);\nskiplist.search(1);   // return true.\n\nskiplist.erase(0);    // return false, 0 is not in skiplist.\n\nskiplist.erase(1);    // return true.\n\nskiplist.search(1);   // return false, 1 has already been erased.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`0 <= num, target <= 20000`\nAt most `50000` calls will be made to `search`, `add`, and `erase`.",

Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.\n\nEach philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.\n\nEating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.\n\nDesign a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.\n\nThe problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org\nThe philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function `void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork)` where:\n`philosopher` is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.\n\n`pickLeftFork` and `pickRightFork` are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.\n\n`eat` is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.\n\n`putLeftFork` and `putRightFork` are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.\n\nThe philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).\n\nFive threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: [[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]\nExplanation:\nn is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.\n\nThe output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:\noutput[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)\n- a is the id of a philosopher.\n\n- b specifies the fork: {1 : left, 2 : right}.\n\n- c specifies the operation: {1 : pick, 2 : put, 3 : eat}.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= n <= 60`",

You can treat it as a blocking function call which waits for a HTTP request to finish. It is guaranteed that `getUrls(String url)` will return the urls within 15ms.  Single-threaded solutions will exceed the time limit so, can your multi-threaded web crawler do better?\nBelow are two examples explaining the functionality of the problem, for custom testing purposes you'll have three variables urls`, edges` and startUrl`. Notice that you will only have access to startUrl` in your code, while urls` and edges` are not directly accessible to you in code.\n\nFollow up:\nAssume we have 10,000 nodes and 1 billion URLs to crawl. We will deploy the same software onto each node. The software can know about all the nodes. We have to minimize communication between machines and make sure each node does equal amount of work. How would your web crawler design change?\nWhat if one node fails or does not work?\nHow do you know when the crawler is done?\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nurls = [\n  \"http://news.yahoo.com\",\n  \"http://news.yahoo.com/news\",\n  \"http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/\",\n  \"http://news.google.com\",\n  \"http://news.yahoo.com/us\"\n]\nedges = [[2,0],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[0,4]]\nstartUrl = \"http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/\"\nOutput: [\n  \"http://news.yahoo.com\",\n  \"http://news.yahoo.com/news\",\n  \"http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/\",\n  \"http://news.yahoo.com/us\"\n]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \nurls = [\n  \"http://news.yahoo.com\",\n  \"http://news.yahoo.com/news\",\n  \"http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/\",\n  \"http://news.google.com\"\n]\nedges = [[0,2],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[3,0]]\nstartUrl = \"http://news.google.com\"\nOutput: [\"http://news.google.com\"]\nExplanation: The startUrl links to all other pages that do not share the same hostname.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= urls.length <= 1000`\n`1 <= urls[i].length <= 300`\n`startUrl` is one of the `urls`.\n\nHostname label must be from 1 to 63 characters long, including the dots, may contain only the ASCII letters from 'a' to 'z', digits from '0' to '9' and the hyphen-minus character ('-').\n\nThe hostname may not start or end with the hyphen-minus character ('-'). \nSee:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#Restrictions_on_valid_hostnames\nYou may assume there're no duplicates in url library.",

    "title": "Traffic Light Controlled Intersection",
    "description": "There is an intersection of two roads. First road is road A where cars travel from North to South in direction 1 and from South to North in direction 2. Second road is road B where cars travel from West to East in direction 3 and from East to West in direction 4.\n\nThere is a traffic light located on each road before the intersection. A traffic light can either be green or red.\n\nGreen means cars can cross the intersection in both directions of the road.\n\nRed means cars in both directions cannot cross the intersection and must wait until the light turns green.\n\nThe traffic lights cannot be green on both roads at the same time. That means when the light is green on road A, it is red on road B and when the light is green on road B, it is red on road A.\n\nInitially, the traffic light is green on road A and red on road B. When the light is green on one road, all cars can cross the intersection in both directions until the light becomes green on the other road. No two cars traveling on different roads should cross at the same time.\n\nDesign a deadlock-free traffic light controlled system at this intersection.\n\nImplement the function `void carArrived(carId, roadId, direction, turnGreen, crossCar)` where:\n`carId` is the id of the car that arrived.\n\n`roadId` is the id of the road that the car travels on.\n\n`direction` is the direction of the car.\n\n`turnGreen` is a function you can call to turn the traffic light to green on the current road.\n\n`crossCar` is a function you can call to let the current car cross the intersection.\n\nYour answer is considered correct if it avoids cars deadlock in the intersection. Turning the light green on a road when it was already green is considered a wrong answer.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: cars = [1,3,5,2,4], directions = [2,1,2,4,3], arrivalTimes = [10,20,30,40,50]\nOutput: [\n\"Car 1 Has Passed Road A In Direction 2\",    // Traffic light on road A is green, car 1 can cross the intersection.\n\n\"Car 3 Has Passed Road A In Direction 1\",    // Car 3 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.\n\n\"Car 5 Has Passed Road A In Direction 2\",    // Car 5 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.\n\n\"Traffic Light On Road B Is Green\",          // Car 2 requests green light for road B.\n\n\"Car 2 Has Passed Road B In Direction 4\",    // Car 2 crosses as the light is green on road B now.\n\n\"Car 4 Has Passed Road B In Direction 3\"     // Car 4 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.\n\n]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: cars = [1,2,3,4,5], directions = [2,4,3,3,1], arrivalTimes = [10,20,30,40,40]\nOutput: [\n\"Car 1 Has Passed Road A In Direction 2\",    // Traffic light on road A is green, car 1 can cross the intersection.\n\n\"Traffic Light On Road B Is Green\",          // Car 2 requests green light for road B.\n\n\"Car 2 Has Passed Road B In Direction 4\",    // Car 2 crosses as the light is green on road B now.\n\n\"Car 3 Has Passed Road B In Direction 3\",    // Car 3 crosses as the light is green on road B now.\n\n\"Traffic Light On Road A Is Green\",          // Car 5 requests green light for road A.\n\n\"Car 5 Has Passed Road A In Direction 1\",    // Car 5 crosses as the light is green on road A now.\n\n\"Traffic Light On Road B Is Green\",          // Car 4 requests green light for road B. Car 4 blocked until car 5 crosses and then traffic light is green on road B.\n\n\"Car 4 Has Passed Road B In Direction 3\"     // Car 4 crosses as the light is green on road B now.\n\n]\nExplanation: This is a dead-lock free scenario. Note that the scenario when car 4 crosses before turning light into green on road A and allowing car 5 to pass is also correct and Accepted scenario.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= cars.length <= 20`\n`cars.length = directions.length`\n`cars.length = arrivalTimes.length`\nAll values of `cars` are unique\n`1 <= directions[i] <= 4`\n`arrivalTimes` is non-decreasing",

    "description": "Given the array `restaurants` where  `restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi, veganFriendlyi, pricei, distancei]`. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.\n\nThe `veganFriendly` filter will be either true (meaning you should only include restaurants with `veganFriendlyi` set to true) or false (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters `maxPrice` and `maxDistance` which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.\n\nReturn the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from highest to lowest. For simplicity `veganFriendlyi` and `veganFriendly` take value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10\nOutput: [3,1,5] \nExplanation: \nThe restaurants are:\nRestaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10]\nRestaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5]\nRestaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4]\nRestaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]\nRestaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1] \nAfter filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest). \n\nExample 2:\nInput: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10\nOutput: [4,3,2,1,5]\nExplanation: The restaurants are the same as in example 1, but in this case the filter veganFriendly = 0, therefore all restaurants are considered.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 30, maxDistance = 3\nOutput: [4,5]\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= restaurants.length <= 10^4`\n`restaurants[i].length == 5`\n`1 <= idi, ratingi, pricei, distancei <= 10^5`\n`1 <= maxPrice, maxDistance <= 10^5`\n`veganFriendlyi` and `veganFriendly` are 0 or 1.\n\nAll `idi` are distinct.",

(i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i][j - 1]`)\n3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i + 1][j]`)\n4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i - 1][j]`)\nNotice that there could be some invalid signs on the cells of the `grid` which points outside the `grid`.\n\nYou will initially start at the upper left cell `(0,0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell `(0,0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)` following the signs on the grid. The valid path doesn't have to be the shortest.\n\nYou can modify the sign on a cell with `cost = 1`. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.\n\nReturn the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: You will start at point (0, 0).\n\nThe path to (3, 3) is as follows.

The street of `grid[i][j]` can be:\n1 which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.\n\n2 which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.\n\n3 which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.\n\n4 which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.\n\n5 which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.\n\n6 which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.\n\nYou will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell `(0,0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell `(0,0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`. The path should only follow the streets.\n\nNotice that you are not allowed to change any street.\n\nReturn true if there is a valid path in the grid or false otherwise.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)\n\nExample 3:\nInput: grid = [[1,1,2]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2).\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,3]]\nOutput: true\n\nExample 5:\nInput: grid = [[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[6]]\nOutput: true\n\nConstraints:\n`m == grid.length`\n`n == grid[i].length`\n`1 <= m, n <= 300`\n`1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6`",

    "description": "Given the array `nums`, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is strictly greater than the sum of the non included elements in such subsequence. \nIf there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with minimum size and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the maximum total sum of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array. \nNote that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be unique. Also return the answer sorted in non-increasing order.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [4,3,10,9,8]\nOutput: [10,9] \nExplanation: The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included, however, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements. \n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [4,4,7,6,7]\nOutput: [7,7,6] \nExplanation: The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions.

On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2 or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.\n\nThe score of each player is the sum of values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.\n\nThe objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.\n\nAssume Alice and Bob play optimally.\n\nReturn \"Alice\" if Alice will win, \"Bob\" if Bob will win or \"Tie\" if they end the game with the same score.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: values = [1,2,3,7]\nOutput: \"Bob\"\nExplanation: Alice will always lose.

You will be given an integer array `balls` of size `k` where `balls[i]` is the number of balls of color `i`. \nAll the balls will be shuffled uniformly at random, then we will distribute the first `n` balls to the first box and the remaining `n` balls to the other box (Please read the explanation of the second example carefully).\n\nPlease note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors `a` and `b`, and two boxes `[]` and `()`, then the distribution `[a] (b)` is considered different than the distribution `[b] (a) `(Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).\n\nWe want to calculate the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: balls = [1,1]\nOutput: 1.00000\nExplanation: Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:\n- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2\n- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2\nIn both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal.

    "description": "Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the `nth` lake, the `nth` lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake which is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.\n\nGiven an integer array `rains` where:\n`rains[i] > 0` means there will be rains over the `rains[i]` lake.\n\n`rains[i] == 0` means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.\n\nReturn an array `ans` where:\n`ans.length == rains.length`\n`ans[i] == -1` if `rains[i] > 0`.\n\n`ans[i]` is the lake you choose to dry in the `ith` day if `rains[i] == 0`.\n\nIf there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.\n\nNotice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)\n\nExample 1:\nInput: rains = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [-1,-1,-1,-1]\nExplanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]\nAfter the second day full lakes are [1,2]\nAfter the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]\nAfter the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]\nThere's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]\nOutput: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]\nExplanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]\nAfter the second day full lakes are [1,2]\nAfter the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]\nAfter the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.\n\nAfter the fifth day, full lakes are [2].\n\nAfter the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].\n\nIt is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.\n\nAfter that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: rains = [69,0,0,0,69]\nOutput: [-1,69,1,1,-1]\nExplanation: Any solution on one of the forms [-1,69,x,y,-1], [-1,x,69,y,-1] or [-1,x,y,69,-1] is acceptable where 1 <= x,y <= 10^9\n\nExample 5:\nInput: rains = [10,20,20]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: It will rain over lake 20 two consecutive days. There is no chance to dry any lake.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= rains.length <= 105`\n`0 <= rains[i] <= 109`",

    "description": "Given a weighted undirected connected graph with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.\n\nFind all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.\n\nNote that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]\nExplanation: The figure above describes the graph.\n\nThe following figure shows all the possible MSTs:\nNotice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.\n\nThe edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]\nOutput: [[],[0,1,2,3]]\nExplanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`2 <= n <= 100`\n`1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)`\n`edges[i].length == 3`\n`0 <= ai < bi < n`\n`1 <= weighti <= 1000`\nAll pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.",

The unique ID should be used once for each user, but when a user leaves the system, the ID can be reused again.\n\nUsers can request a certain chunk of the file, the system should return a list of IDs of all the users who own this chunk. If the user receive a non-empty list of IDs, they receive the requested chunk successfully.\n\nImplement the `FileSharing` class:\n`FileSharing(int m)` Initializes the object with a file of `m` chunks.\n\n`int join(int[] ownedChunks)`: A new user joined the system owning some chunks of the file, the system should assign an id to the user which is the smallest positive integer not taken by any other user. Return the assigned id.\n\n`void leave(int userID)`: The user with `userID` will leave the system, you cannot take file chunks from them anymore.\n\n`int[] request(int userID, int chunkID)`: The user `userID` requested the file chunk with `chunkID`. Return a list of the IDs of all users that own this chunk sorted in ascending order.\n\nFollow-ups:\nWhat happens if the system identifies the user by their IP address instead of their unique ID and users disconnect and connect from the system with the same IP?\nIf the users in the system join and leave the system frequently without requesting any chunks, will your solution still be efficient?\nIf all each user join the system one time, request all files and then leave, will your solution still be efficient?\nIf the system will be used to share `n` files where the `ith` file consists of `m[i]`, what are the changes you have to do?\n\nExample:\nInput:\n[\"FileSharing\",\"join\",\"join\",\"join\",\"request\",\"request\",\"leave\",\"request\",\"leave\",\"join\"]\n[[4],[[1,2]],[[2,3]],[[4]],[1,3],[2,2],[1],[2,1],[2],[[]]]\nOutput:\n[null,1,2,3,[2],[1,2],null,[],null,1]\nExplanation:\nFileSharing fileSharing = new FileSharing(4); // We use the system to share a file of 4 chunks.\n\nfileSharing.join([1, 2]);    // A user who has chunks [1,2] joined the system, assign id = 1 to them and return 1.\n\nfileSharing.join([2, 3]);    // A user who has chunks [2,3] joined the system, assign id = 2 to them and return 2.\n\nfileSharing.join([4]);       // A user who has chunk [4] joined the system, assign id = 3 to them and return 3.\n\nfileSharing.request(1, 3);   // The user with id = 1 requested the third file chunk, as only the user with id = 2 has the file, return [2] . Notice that user 1 now has chunks [1,2,3].\n\nfileSharing.request(2, 2);   // The user with id = 2 requested the second file chunk, users with ids [1,2] have this chunk, thus we return [1,2].\n\nfileSharing.leave(1);        // The user with id = 1 left the system, all the file chunks with them are no longer available for other users.\n\nfileSharing.request(2, 1);   // The user with id = 2 requested the first file chunk, no one in the system has this chunk, we return empty list [].\n\nfileSharing.leave(2);        // The user with id = 2 left the system.\n\nfileSharing.join([]);        // A user who doesn't have any chunks joined the system, assign id = 1 to them and return 1.

If the serialized value and the input data are the same, the test passes.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: tree = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]\nOutput: [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]\nExplanation: The tree from the input data is shown above.\n\nThe driver code creates the tree and gives findRoot the Node objects in an arbitrary order.\n\nFor example, the passed array could be [Node(5),Node(4),Node(3),Node(6),Node(2),Node(1)] or [Node(2),Node(6),Node(1),Node(3),Node(5),Node(4)].\n\nThe findRoot function should return the root Node(1), and the driver code will serialize it and compare with the input data.\n\nThe input data and serialized Node(1) are the same, so the test passes.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: tree = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]\nOutput: [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]\n\nConstraints:\nThe total number of nodes is between `[1, 5 * 104]`.\n\nEach node has a unique value.\n\nFollow up:\nCould you solve this problem in constant space complexity with a linear time algorithm?",

If `p` is already a direct child of `q`, don't change anything. Node `p` must be the last child in the children list of node `q`.\n\nReturn the root of the tree after adjusting it.\n\nThere are 3 cases for nodes `p` and `q`:\nNode `q` is in the sub-tree of node `p`.\n\nNode `p` is in the sub-tree of node `q`.\n\nNeither node `p` is in the sub-tree of node `q` nor node `q` is in the sub-tree of node `p`.\n\nIn cases 2 and 3, you just need to move `p` (with its sub-tree) to be a child of `q`, but in case 1 the tree may be disconnected, thus you need to reconnect the tree again. Please read the examples carefully before solving this problem.\n\nNary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).\n\nFor example, the above tree is serialized as [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14].\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 4, q = 1\nOutput: [1,null,2,3,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,8]\nExplanation: This example follows the second case as node p is in the sub-tree of node q. We move node p with its sub-tree to be a direct child of node q.\n\nNotice that node 4 is the last child of node 1.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 7, q = 4\nOutput: [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8]\nExplanation: Node 7 is already a direct child of node 4. We don't change anything.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 3, q = 8\nOutput: [1,null,2,null,4,5,null,7,8,null,null,null,3,null,6]\nExplanation: This example follows case 3 because node p is not in the sub-tree of node q and vice-versa. We can move node 3 with its sub-tree and make it as node 8's child.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 2, q = 7\nOutput: [1,null,7,3,null,2,null,6,null,4,5,null,null,8]\nExplanation: Node q is in the sub-tree of node p, so this is case 1.\n\nThe first step, we move node p (with all of its sub-tree except for node q) and add it as a child to node q.\n\nThen we will see that the tree is disconnected, you need to reconnect node q to replace node p as shown.\n\n\nExample 5:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 1, q = 2\nOutput: [2,null,4,5,1,null,7,8,null,null,3,null,null,null,6]\nExplanation: Node q is in the sub-tree of node p, so this is case 1.\n\nThe first step, we move node p (with all of its sub-tree except for node q) and add it as a child to node q.\n\nAs node p was the root of the tree, node q replaces it and becomes the root of the tree.\n\n\nConstraints:\nThe total number of nodes is between `[2, 1000]`.\n\nEach node has a unique value.\n\n`p != null`\n`q != null`\n`p` and `q` are two different nodes (i.e. `p != q`).",

Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.\n\nNode 1 has a label 'b'.

    "description": "Given a string `s` of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of non-empty substrings of `s` that meet the following conditions:\nThe substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings `s[i..j]` and `s[k..l]`, either `j < k` or `i > l` is true.\n\nA substring that contains a certain character `c` must also contain all occurrences of `c`.\n\nFind the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.\n\nNotice that you can return the substrings in any order.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"adefaddaccc\"\nOutput: [\"e\",\"f\",\"ccc\"]\nExplanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:\n[\n  \"adefaddaccc\"\n  \"adefadda\",\n  \"ef\",\n  \"e\",\n  \"f\",\n  \"ccc\",\n]\nIf we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose \"adefadda\", we are left with \"ccc\" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose \"ef\" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [\"e\",\"f\",\"ccc\"] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"abbaccd\"\nOutput: [\"d\",\"bb\",\"cc\"]\nExplanation: Notice that while the set of substrings [\"d\",\"abba\",\"cc\"] also has length 3, it's considered incorrect since it has larger total length.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= s.length <= 10^5`\n`s` contains only lowercase English letters.",

    "title": "String Compression II",
    "description": "Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string `\"aabccc\"` we replace `\"aa\"` by `\"a2\"` and replace `\"ccc\"` by `\"c3\"`. Thus the compressed string becomes `\"a2bc3\"`.\n\nNotice that in this problem, we are not adding `'1'` after single characters.\n\nGiven a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to delete at most `k` characters from `s` such that the run-length encoded version of `s` has minimum length.\n\nFind the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of `s` after deleting at most `k` characters.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"aaabcccd\", k = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us \"a3bc3d\" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = \"abcccd\" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be \"a3c3\" of length 4.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"aabbaa\", k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be \"a4\" of length 2.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = \"aaaaaaaaaaa\", k = 0\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is \"a11\" of length 3.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= s.length <= 100`\n`0 <= k <= s.length`\n`s` contains only lowercase English letters.",

When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.\n\nReturn the minimum total cost of the cuts.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]\nOutput: 16\nExplanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:\nThe first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.\n\nRearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]\nOutput: 22\nExplanation: If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.\n\nThere are much ordering with total cost <= 25, for example, the order [4, 6, 5, 2, 1] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`2 <= n <= 10^6`\n`1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)`\n`1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1`\nAll the integers in `cuts` array are distinct.",

Another valid pattern (2,1) is also repeated 2 times.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,3], m = 2, k = 3\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The pattern (1,2) is of length 2 but is repeated only 2 times. There is no pattern of length 2 that is repeated 3 or more times.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: arr = [1,2,3,1,2], m = 2, k = 2\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Notice that the pattern (1,2) exists twice but not consecutively, so it doesn't count.\n\n\nExample 5:\nInput: arr = [2,2,2,2], m = 2, k = 3\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The only pattern of length 2 is (2,2) however it's repeated only twice.

Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with 2 children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).\n\nFor each internal node with operator `o`, the infix expression that it represents is `(A o B)`, where `A` is the expression the left subtree represents and `B` is the expression the right subtree represents.\n\nYou are given a string `s`, an infix expression containing operands, the operators described above, and parentheses `'('` and `')'`.\n\nReturn any valid binary expression tree, which its in-order traversal reproduces `s` after omitting the parenthesis from it (see examples below).\n\nPlease note that order of operations applies in `s`.

Each customer pays `boardingCost` dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.\n\nYou can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.\n\nReturn the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return `-1`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: customers = [8,3], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.\n\n1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $5 - 1 * $6 = $14.\n\n2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $5 - 2 * $6 = $28.\n\n3. The final 3 customers board the gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $5 - 3 * $6 = $37.\n\nThe highest profit was $37 after rotating the wheel 3 times.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: customers = [10,9,6], boardingCost = 6, runningCost = 4\nOutput: 7\nExplanation:\n1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $6 - 1 * $4 = $20.\n\n2. 9 customers arrive, 4 board and 11 wait (2 originally waiting, 9 newly waiting), the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $6 - 2 * $4 = $40.\n\n3. The final 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $6 - 3 * $4 = $60.\n\n4. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $6 - 4 * $4 = $80.\n\n5. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $6 - 5 * $4 = $100.\n\n6. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $6 - 6 * $4 = $120.\n\n7. 1 boards, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 25 * $6 - 7 * $4 = $122.\n\nThe highest profit was $122 after rotating the wheel 7 times.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: customers = [3,4,0,5,1], boardingCost = 1, runningCost = 92\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\n1. 3 customers arrive, 3 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 3 * $1 - 1 * $92 = -$89.\n\n2. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 2 * $92 = -$177.\n\n3. 0 customers arrive, 0 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 3 * $92 = -$269.\n\n4. 5 customers arrive, 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $1 - 4 * $92 = -$357.\n\n5. 1 customer arrives, 2 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 13 * $1 - 5 * $92 = -$447.\n\nThe profit was never positive, so return -1.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: customers = [10,10,6,4,7], boardingCost = 3, runningCost = 8\nOutput: 9\nExplanation:\n1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $3 - 1 * $8 = $4.\n\n2. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 12 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $3 - 2 * $8 = $8.\n\n3. 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 14 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $3 - 3 * $8 = $12.\n\n4. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 14 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $3 - 4 * $8 = $16.\n\n5. 7 customers arrive, 4 board and 17 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $3 - 5 * $8 = $20.\n\n6. 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $3 - 6 * $8 = $24.\n\n7. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 28 * $3 - 7 * $8 = $28.\n\n8. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 32 * $3 - 8 * $8 = $32.\n\n9. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 36 * $3 - 9 * $8 = $36.\n\n10. 1 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 37 * $3 - 10 * $8 = $31.\n\nThe highest profit was $36 after rotating the wheel 9 times.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`n == customers.length`\n`1 <= n <= 105`\n`0 <= customers[i] <= 50`\n`1 <= boardingCost, runningCost <= 100`",

Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.\n\nThe kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function `Successor(x, curOrder)`, which given a person `x` and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after `x` in the order of inheritance.\n\nSuccessor(x, curOrder):\n    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:\n        if x is the king return null\n        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)\n    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder\nFor example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.\n\nIn the beginning, `curOrder` will be `[\"king\"]`.\n\nCalling `Successor(king, curOrder)` will return Alice, so we append to `curOrder` to get `[\"king\", \"Alice\"]`.\n\nCalling `Successor(Alice, curOrder)` will return Jack, so we append to `curOrder` to get `[\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"]`.\n\nCalling `Successor(Jack, curOrder)` will return Bob, so we append to `curOrder` to get `[\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\", \"Bob\"]`.\n\nCalling `Successor(Bob, curOrder)` will return `null`.

    "description": "You have `k` servers numbered from `0` to `k-1` that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:\nThe `ith` (0-indexed) request arrives.\n\nIf all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).\n\nIf the `(i % k)th` server is available, assign the request to that server.\n\nOtherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the `ith` server is busy, try to assign the request to the `(i+1)th` server, then the `(i+2)th` server, and so on.\n\nYou are given a strictly increasing array `arrival` of positive integers, where `arrival[i]` represents the arrival time of the `ith` request, and another array `load`, where `load[i]` represents the load of the `ith` request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.\n\nReturn a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] \nOutput: [1] \nExplanation:\nAll of the servers start out available.\n\nThe first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.\n\nRequest 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.\n\nRequest 4 comes in.

You can choose any font size from array `fonts`, which contains the available font sizes in ascending order.\n\nYou can use the `FontInfo` interface to get the width and height of any character at any available font size.\n\nThe `FontInfo` interface is defined as such:\ninterface FontInfo {\n  // Returns the width of character ch on the screen using font size fontSize.\n\n  // O(1) per call\n  public int getWidth(int fontSize, char ch);\n  // Returns the height of any character on the screen using font size fontSize.\n\n  // O(1) per call\n  public int getHeight(int fontSize);\n}\nThe calculated width of `text` for some `fontSize` is the sum of every `getWidth(fontSize, text[i])` call for each `0 <= i < text.length` (0-indexed). The calculated height of `text` for some `fontSize` is `getHeight(fontSize)`. Note that `text` is displayed on a single line.\n\nIt is guaranteed that `FontInfo` will return the same value if you call `getHeight` or `getWidth` with the same parameters.\n\nIt is also guaranteed that for any font size `fontSize` and any character `ch`:\n`getHeight(fontSize) <= getHeight(fontSize+1)`\n`getWidth(fontSize, ch) <= getWidth(fontSize+1, ch)`\nReturn the maximum font size you can use to display `text` on the screen.

The tower is reachable if the distance is less than or equal to `radius`. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is not reachable.\n\nThe signal quality of the `ith` tower at a coordinate `(x, y)` is calculated with the formula `⌊qi / (1 + d)⌋`, where `d` is the distance between the tower and the coordinate.

    "description": "Given the `postfix` tokens of an arithmetic expression, build and return the binary expression tree that represents this expression.\n\nPostfix notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which the operands (numbers) appear before their operators. For example, the postfix tokens of the expression `4*(5-(7+2))` are represented in the array `postfix = [\"4\",\"5\",\"7\",\"2\",\"+\",\"-\",\"*\"]`.\n\nThe class `Node` is an interface you should use to implement the binary expression tree. The returned tree will be tested using the `evaluate` function, which is supposed to evaluate the tree's value. You should not remove the `Node` class; however, you can modify it as you wish, and you can define other classes to implement it if needed.\n\nA binary expression tree is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).\n\nIt's guaranteed that no subtree will yield a value that exceeds `109` in absolute value, and all the operations are valid (i.e., no division by zero).\n\nFollow up: Could you design the expression tree such that it is more modular? For example, is your design able to support additional operators without making changes to your existing `evaluate` implementation?\n\nExample 1:\nInput: s = [\"3\",\"4\",\"+\",\"2\",\"*\",\"7\",\"/\"]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression (`(3+4)*2)/7) = 14/7 = 2.`\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = [\"4\",\"5\",\"7\",\"2\",\"+\",\"-\",\"*\"]\nOutput: -16\nExplanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression 4*(5-`(2+7)) = 4*(-4) = -16.`\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = [\"4\",\"2\",\"+\",\"3\",\"5\",\"1\",\"-\",\"*\",\"+\"]\nOutput: 18\n\nExample 4:\nInput: s = [\"100\",\"200\",\"+\",\"2\",\"/\",\"5\",\"*\",\"7\",\"+\"]\nOutput: 757\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= s.length < 100`\n`s.length` is odd.\n\n`s` consists of numbers and the characters `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.\n\nIf `s[i]` is a number, its integer representation is no more than `105`.\n\nIt is guaranteed that `s` is a valid expression.\n\nThe absolute value of the result and intermediate values will not exceed `109`.\n\nIt is guaranteed that no expression will include division by zero.",

Return the maximum possible grid happiness.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2\nOutput: 240\nExplanation: Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).\n\nWe can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).\n\n- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120\n- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60\n- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60\nThe grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.\n\nThe above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1\nOutput: 260\nExplanation: Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).\n\n- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90\n- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80\n- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90\nThe grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 4, extrovertsCount = 0\nOutput: 240\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= m, n <= 5`\n`0 <= introvertsCount, extrovertsCount <= min(m * n, 6)`",

The ship will follow these steps:\nThe ship will take some number of boxes from the `boxes` queue, not violating the `maxBoxes` and `maxWeight` constraints.\n\nFor each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it.

    "title": "Reformat Phone Number",
    "description": "You are given a phone number as a string `number`. `number` consists of digits, spaces `' '`, and/or dashes `'-'`.\n\nYou would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then, group the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:\n2 digits: A single block of length 2.\n\n3 digits: A single block of length 3.\n\n4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.\n\nThe blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should never produce any blocks of length 1 and produce at most two blocks of length 2.\n\nReturn the phone number after formatting.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: number = \"1-23-45 6\"\nOutput: \"123-456\"\nExplanation: The digits are \"123456\".\n\nStep 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is \"123\".\n\nStep 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is \"456\".\n\nJoining the blocks gives \"123-456\".\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: number = \"123 4-567\"\nOutput: \"123-45-67\"\nExplanation: The digits are \"1234567\".\n\nStep 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is \"123\".\n\nStep 2: There are 4 digits left, so split them into two blocks of length 2. The blocks are \"45\" and \"67\".\n\nJoining the blocks gives \"123-45-67\".\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: number = \"123 4-5678\"\nOutput: \"123-456-78\"\nExplanation: The digits are \"12345678\".\n\nStep 1: The 1st block is \"123\".\n\nStep 2: The 2nd block is \"456\".\n\nStep 3: There are 2 digits left, so put them in a single block of length 2. The 3rd block is \"78\".\n\nJoining the blocks gives \"123-456-78\".\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: number = \"12\"\nOutput: \"12\"\n\nExample 5:\nInput: number = \"--17-5 229 35-39475 \"\nOutput: \"175-229-353-94-75\"\n\nConstraints:\n`2 <= number.length <= 100`\n`number` consists of digits and the characters `'-'` and `' '`.\n\nThere are at least two digits in `number`.",

Each node has a value associated with it, and the root of the tree is node `0`.\n\nTo represent this tree, you are given an integer array `nums` and a 2D array `edges`. Each `nums[i]` represents the `ith` node's value, and each `edges[j] = [uj, vj]` represents an edge between nodes `uj` and `vj` in the tree.\n\nTwo values `x` and `y` are coprime if `gcd(x, y) == 1` where `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.\n\nAn ancestor of a node `i` is any other node on the shortest path from node `i` to the root. A node is not considered an ancestor of itself.\n\nReturn an array `ans` of size `n`, where `ans[i]` is the closest ancestor to node `i` such that `nums[i]` and `nums[ans[i]]` are coprime, or `-1` if there is no such ancestor.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,3,3,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]]\nOutput: [-1,0,0,1]\nExplanation: In the above figure, each node's value is in parentheses.\n\n- Node 0 has no coprime ancestors.\n\n- Node 1 has only one ancestor, node 0.

Node 1's value is not coprime (gcd(3,3) == 3), but node 0's\n  value is (gcd(2,3) == 1), so node 0 is the closest valid ancestor.\n\n- Node 3 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. It is coprime with node 1 (gcd(3,2) == 1), so node 1 is its\n  closest valid ancestor.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [5,6,10,2,3,6,15], edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]]\nOutput: [-1,0,-1,0,0,0,-1]\n\nConstraints:\n`nums.length == n`\n`1 <= nums[i] <= 50`\n`1 <= n <= 105`\n`edges.length == n - 1`\n`edges[j].length == 2`\n`0 <= uj, vj < n`\n`uj != vj`",

It is guaranteed that `positioni < positioni+1`.\n\n`speedi` is the initial speed of the `ith` car in meters per second.\n\nFor simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the slowest car in the fleet.\n\nReturn an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the time, in seconds, at which the `ith` car collides with the next car, or `-1` if the car does not collide with the next car.

    "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nThere is a robot in a hidden grid, and you are trying to get it from its starting cell to the target cell in this grid. The grid is of size `m x n`, and each cell in the grid is either empty or blocked. It is guaranteed that the starting cell and the target cell are different, and neither of them is blocked.\n\nYou want to find the minimum distance to the target cell. However, you do not know the grid's dimensions, the starting cell, nor the target cell. You are only allowed to ask queries to the `GridMaster` object.\n\nThr `GridMaster` class has the following functions:\n`boolean canMove(char direction)` Returns `true` if the robot can move in that direction. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n`void move(char direction)` Moves the robot in that direction. If this move would move the robot to a blocked cell or off the grid, the move will be ignored, and the robot will remain in the same position.\n\n`boolean isTarget()` Returns `true` if the robot is currently on the target cell. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nNote that `direction` in the above functions should be a character from `{'U','D','L','R'}`, representing the directions up, down, left, and right, respectively.\n\nReturn the minimum distance between the robot's initial starting cell and the target cell. If there is no valid path between the cells, return `-1`.\n\nCustom testing:\nThe test input is read as a 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n` where:\n`grid[i][j] == -1` indicates that the robot is in cell `(i, j)` (the starting cell).\n\n`grid[i][j] == 0` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is blocked.\n\n`grid[i][j] == 1` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is empty.\n\n`grid[i][j] == 2` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is the target cell.\n\nThere is exactly one `-1` and `2` in `grid`. Remember that you will not have this information in your code.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: grid = [[1,2],[-1,0]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: One possible interaction is described below:\nThe robot is initially standing on cell (1, 0), denoted by the -1.\n\n- master.canMove('U') returns true.\n\n- master.canMove('D') returns false.\n\n- master.canMove('L') returns false.\n\n- master.canMove('R') returns false.\n\n- master.move('U') moves the robot to the cell (0, 0).\n\n- master.isTarget() returns false.\n\n- master.canMove('U') returns false.\n\n- master.canMove('D') returns true.\n\n- master.canMove('L') returns false.\n\n- master.canMove('R') returns true.\n\n- master.move('R') moves the robot to the cell (0, 1).\n\n- master.isTarget() returns true. \nWe now know that the target is the cell (0, 1), and the shortest path to the target cell is 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: grid = [[0,0,-1],[1,1,1],[2,0,0]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The minimum distance between the robot and the target cell is 4.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: grid = [[-1,0],[0,2]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: There is no path from the robot to the target cell.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= n, m <= 500`\n`m == grid.length`\n`n == grid[i].length`\n`grid[i][j]` is either `-1`, `0`, `1`, or `2`.\n\nThere is exactly one `-1` in `grid`.\n\nThere is exactly one `2` in `grid`.",

    "title": "Number of Orders in the Backlog",
    "description": "You are given a 2D integer array `orders`, where each `orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei]` denotes that `amounti` orders have been placed of type `orderTypei` at the price `pricei`. The `orderTypei` is:\n`0` if it is a batch of `buy` orders, or\n`1` if it is a batch of `sell` orders.\n\nNote that `orders[i]` represents a batch of `amounti` independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by `orders[i]` will be placed before all orders represented by `orders[i+1]` for all valid `i`.\n\nThere is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:\nIf the order is a `buy` order, you look at the `sell` order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that `sell` order's price is smaller than or equal to the current `buy` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `sell` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `buy` order is added to the backlog.\n\nVice versa, if the order is a `sell` order, you look at the `buy` order with the largest price in the backlog. If that `buy` order's price is larger than or equal to the current `sell` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `buy` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `sell` order is added to the backlog.\n\nReturn the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Here is what happens with the orders:\n- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.\n\n- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.\n\n- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.\n\n- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.\n\nFinally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]\nOutput: 999999984\nExplanation: Here is what happens with the orders:\n- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.\n\n- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.\n\n- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.\n\n- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.\n\nFinally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= orders.length <= 105`\n`orders[i].length == 3`\n`1 <= pricei, amounti <= 109`\n`orderTypei` is either `0` or `1`.",

    "title": "Find the Winner of the Circular Game",
    "description": "There are `n` friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from `1` to `n` in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the `ith` friend brings you to the `(i+1)th` friend for `1 <= i < n`, and moving clockwise from the `nth` friend brings you to the `1st` friend.\n\nThe rules of the game are as follows:\nStart at the `1st` friend.\n\nCount the next `k` friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.\n\nThe last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.\n\nIf there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step `2` starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.\n\nElse, the last friend in the circle wins the game.\n\nGiven the number of friends, `n`, and an integer `k`, return the winner of the game.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 5, k = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Here are the steps of the game:\n1) Start at friend 1.\n\n2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.\n\n3) Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.\n\n4) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.\n\n5) Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.\n\n6) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.\n\n7) Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.\n\n8) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.\n\n9) Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 6, k = 5\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The friends leave in this order: 5, 4, 6, 2, 3. The winner is friend 1.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= k <= n <= 500`",

    "description": "There is a 3 lane road of length `n` that consists of `n + 1` points labeled from `0` to `n`. A frog starts at point `0` in the second lane and wants to jump to point `n`. However, there could be obstacles along the way.\n\nYou are given an array `obstacles` of length `n + 1` where each `obstacles[i]` (ranging from 0 to 3) describes an obstacle on the lane `obstacles[i]` at point `i`. If `obstacles[i] == 0`, there are no obstacles at point `i`. There will be at most one obstacle in the 3 lanes at each point.\n\nFor example, if `obstacles[2] == 1`, then there is an obstacle on lane 1 at point 2.\n\nThe frog can only travel from point `i` to point `i + 1` on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point `i + 1`. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a side jump to jump to another lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the same point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.\n\nFor example, the frog can jump from lane 3 at point 3 to lane 1 at point 3.\n\nReturn the minimum number of side jumps the frog needs to reach any lane at point n starting from lane `2` at point 0.\n\nNote: There will be no obstacles on points `0` and `n`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: obstacles = [0,1,2,3,0]\nOutput: 2 \nExplanation: The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps (red arrows).\n\nNote that the frog can jump over obstacles only when making side jumps (as shown at point 2).\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: obstacles = [0,1,1,3,3,0]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no obstacles on lane 2. No side jumps are required.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: obstacles = [0,2,1,0,3,0]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above.
